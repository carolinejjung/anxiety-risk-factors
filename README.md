# anxiety-risk-factors

This project started as a final group project for a multivariate data analysis course (spring 2023) using R. Anxiety disorders in the elderly population often go undiagnosed, even though they affect 10-20% of older adults. Our analysis investigates factors associated with risk of anxiety in older adults. We analyzed a dataset containing medical information about adults aged 70-85, with metrics including measures of physical fitness, history of medical incidents, social interaction, and cognitive ability. We first performed penalized lasso regression on the data to select the most promising predictors for anxiety. Then, our subsequent analysis fits multiple models on these predictors to explore the significant factors and predictive performance of each model. We use methods including stepwise regression, a regression tree, and tree-based ensemble methods. Based on 5-fold cross validation, the stepwise regression models yielded the best predictions for anxiety scores. Additionally, we found that younger age, more pre-existing comorbidities, higher depression score, and more time spent on phones were all associated with higher anxiety scores.
